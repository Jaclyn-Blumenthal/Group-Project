    <h1>Italy</h1> 
    <br>
        <p>The historic and legendary city of Rome, endless amounts of the finest wine from the most exquisite vineyards in the world, enough spaghetti to feed you for millenials, one of a kind hilltowns as well as coastal cities...these are just a FEW of the reasons to visit Italy. One of our highly recommended resorts is the Lefay Resort & SPA Lago di Garda located in Gargnano. For more information on the resort check out their website: <a href="https://www.lefayresorts.com/" target="_blank" style="color: blanchedalmond; font-size: 20px;">Lefay Resort</a> </p>
